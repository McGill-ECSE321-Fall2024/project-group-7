## Scope
Our application GameCenter will be a Full Stack application which is built upon the following prompt:
> The owner of an independent game shop wants to expand their business with an online store. You’re tasked with developing a web application that allows the owner and the employees to manage their product catalog, inventory, and customer orders. The application should also provide a user-friendly interface for customers, allowing them to browse and purchase games online. The store offers a variety of video games. Store staff can update the inventory, add new games, and remove games. When new games are added, the employees need to specify the category of the games. The games can be published only after the owner approves. Customers can create an account, purchase games, track their order history, and save items to a wish list for future purchases. The customers can also post reviews for the games that they purchased. The owner needs an administrative dashboard where they can manage the store employees, the game categories and the available games; review customers’ order history, review and reply to user reviews; and update store information like store policies and special promotions.
